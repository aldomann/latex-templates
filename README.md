# LaTeX Templates

[LaTeX][latex] is a typesetting program for producing high quality technical documents.
Formatting LaTeX documents is difficult and modifying pre-built templates often require extensive knowledge of the template.

This repository contains simple LaTeX templates for common documents. The package `babel` (and thus, `biblatex`) is configured to use Catalan (`catalan`), but it can be easily changed to use English (`british`), Spanish (`spanish`), or any [other language][babel].
