[LaTeX][latex] is a typesetting program for producing high quality technical documents. Formatting LaTeX documents is difficult and modifying pre-built templates often require extensive knowledge of the template.

This repository contains simple LaTeX templates for common documents. These templates are mainly for personal use, so don't expect heavily commented preambles. Anyway, you can find the documentation for most (if not all) LaTeX packages in [CTAN][ctan] (Comprehensive TeX Archive Network).

The package `babel` (and thus, `biblatex`) is configured to use Catalan (`catalan`), but it can be easily changed to use English (`british`), Spanish (`spanish` or `spanish, es-tabla` [more info about this [here][es-table]]), or any [other language][babel].
